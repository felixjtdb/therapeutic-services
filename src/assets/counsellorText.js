  main: "I am passionate about helping clients to make sense of their world, tailoring techniques and interventions \
  to create an effective therapy. It is a partnership and we can work as fast or slow as you like, this can \
  mean weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Initially it is helpful to see each other weekly for a period as this \
  helps to keep up the momentum of therapy.\n\n\
  I have an open minded compassionate approach and I do not believe I am the expert who can tell you \
  what changes to make, instead I am a trained professional who can sit alongside you and use my expertise \
  to help you to work out what is blocking you from living the life you want.\n\n\
  We will explore the links between thoughts, behaviour and mood, how we can often get caught up in our \
  minds and are unable to break out of this state, it can also help to look at these patterns, and feel we have \
  to a space to talk and feel heard. I have worked in private practice for over 10 years so have expereince of \
  working with a range of emotional issues.\n\n\
  I am a registered member of the BABCP and I abide by the BABCP ethical framework and all our \
  sessions will be confidential. \n\n\
  Please get in touch if you have any questions about working with me, I offer a no commitment 30 minute \
  telephone consultation – email or text me to arrange a convenient time. \n\
  Sessions are 50 minutes long and I charge £45 a session, I require 48 hours notice for cancellation of a \
  session otherwise the full fee will be payable. Payment is due on the day the session is held. Payments \
  are made by bank transfer or cash.",

  make meaning in your life and what your priorities and values are, so that you can work out what you want \
  in life and feel more confident in making choices. Person-centred means that the counselling process is led by \
  you, and that we work together with what you bring and at your pace. The relationship between you and me, as your \
  counsellor, is key to the work and provides a safe and supportive space for you to explore yourself and your \
  experience without judgement or criticism.",
