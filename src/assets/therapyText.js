const therapyTitle = "Therapy explained"

const therapyPara1 = "Common to all training counsellors/therapists consider how people relate, how they think and behave, \
their experiences of the world and how they function in their everyday life. This will include exploring \
people’s social, economic, cultural, spiritual and physical health experiences. We work to reduce \
psychological distress and to promote the well-being of individuals, groups and families. Our training \
however informs the focus of the work."

const therapyPara2 = "To help you decide what sort of therapy you feel will help you, we offer you a short explanation of some \
of the terms we have used in our biographies. We offer a range of approaches and will work with you to \
find the most appropriate therapist and therapeutic approach for your needs."


const integrativeTitle = "Integrative Counselling"
const integrative = "As the name suggests, is a combined approach to psychotherapy that brings together different elements \
of specific therapies. Integrative therapists take the view that there is no single approach that can treat each client in all \
situations. Rather, each person needs to be considered as a whole and counselling techniques must be tailored to their individual \
needs and personal circumstances."

const personCentredTitle = "Person Centred Counselling"
const personCentred = "Person-Centred counselling is based on the principle that the counsellor provides three Core Conditions in \
the therapy room. \
These Conditions are: "

const cbtTitle = "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)"
const cbt = "Cognitive behavioural therapies, or CBT, are a range of talking therapies based on the theory that \
thoughts, feelings, what we do and how our body feels are all connected. If we change one of these we \
can alter the others. \
When people feel worried or distressed we often fall into patterns of thinking and responding which can \
worsen how we feel. CBT works to help us notice and change problematic thinking styles or behaviour \
patterns so we can feel better. CBT has lots of strategies that can help you in the here and now."

const acceptanceCommitmentTitle = "Acceptance & Commitment Therapy"
const acceptanceCommitment = "ACT promotes the development of greater psychological flexibility and is a form of behavioral therapy \
that combines mindfulness skills with the practice of acceptance. \
In the case of ACT, you are committing to facing the problem head-on. Instead of avoiding your \
problems, you commit to actions that will help you stop struggling against the inevitable and facilitate \
thriving instead. \
ACT is effective for a wide range of psycholgical disorders, but it is also effective as a life-affirming and \
inspirational perspective on the world. \
What if you could accept and allow yourself to feel what you feel, even if it’s negative? What would \
happen if you let yourself experience it all, instead of focusing all your effort on evading any potentially \
difficult problems? \
ACT can show you exactly what happens, and how you can harness the power of acceptance to get the \
life you want."

const existentialTitle = "Existential Psychotherapy"
const existential = "Existential therapy focuses on free will, self-determination, and the search for meaning—often \
centering on you rather than on the symptom. The approach emphasizes your capacity to make rational \
choices and to develop to your maximum potential. \
The existential approach stresses that: "

const psychodynamicTitle = "Psychodynamic Psychotherapy"
const psychodynamic = "The psychodynamic approach gives greater emphasis to the impact of our childhood experience than \
some of the other approaches. This means that therapy will not just concentrate on the present problem \
and the way forward but will also focus on the importance of past experiences and past relationships as a \
way of making sense of present concerns. \
The other key difference is a belief in the significance of unconscious processes – that is, psychological \
processes that lie outside our awareness but motivate and effect our feelings and behaviour. \
Psychodynamic practitioners also work with transference – that is, the way in which clients may relate to \
the therapist in a way that is connected to the relationships they have with significant others outside the \
therapy room."

const familySystemicTitle = "Family and Systemic Psychotherapist"
const familySystemic = "No-one lives their life in isolation. Publicly and privately, at work and at home, we all have an impact on \
the people around us. Each of us is one part of a wider network or ‘system’. Our interactions with other\
people are how the system works. \
Imagine that your family at a meal time is a system. Some family members may be happily chatting to \
each other, others may sit in silence throughout the meal, resenting being asked anything. Others may \
argue leading someone else to have to calm the situation and negotiate a peace. And this repeats every \
meal time because you have all developed different ways of relating to each other. These are what a \
Family and System Psychotherapist would dintegrativeescribe as ‘patterns’. \
As time goes by, these systems grow and change as different factors come into play. Perhaps, a child has \
become a teenager, but the parents still treat them as they would a younger child. The patterns no longer \
work, and the system becomes stuck. \
A Family and Systemic Psychotherapist could help you take on a different position, either by working \
with individuals or the whole family. They can look at how different factors affect people within the \
system. They will help emphasise the strengths, resilience and resources available and how everyone \
helps contribute to the functioning of the system. \
The aim is to help everyone understand each other, develop new ways to talk to each other. This can help \
create an environment in which everyone supports each other promoting health and wellbeing."
